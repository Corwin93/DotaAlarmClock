# DotaAlarmClock
- The alarm works in background. So don't be afraid to close it.
- The alarm will not go off until you solve a quiz
- What if I closed the app during quiz solving and the signal doesn't stop?
  Don't worry. Just reopen the app and you will be proposed to solve a new quiz.
- How can I turn off the alarm without solving a quiz?
  You can turn off the sound with hardware key "Volume down" if you really want to have a nap. 
  But to fully turn the alarm off evading the quiz you have to kill the app in your smartphone's Settings menu.
